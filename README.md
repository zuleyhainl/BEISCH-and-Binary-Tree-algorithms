# BEISCH-and-Binary-Tree-algorithms
### For at most 900 random keys, BEISCH and Binary Tree algorithms with C#.NET <br/>
For each algorithm,<br/>
- The program should show the corresponding table on screen 
- For each key value, the program should compute the number of probes required in each algorithm 
- The program should compare the performance of algorithms for a random number of keys value given by the user 
- The program should allow users to search for a key value
